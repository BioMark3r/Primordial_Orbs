# Primordial Orbs — Rulebook (Placeholder)

This file is included as a **starter** so the in-app Rulebook button has a canonical document to reference.

> Note: In your previous project thread we expanded rules, core passives, and added Temporal Vortex + a Core Status Strip.
> Those full rules aren’t available in this session’s filesystem, so this document is a lightweight placeholder.

## Core Objective
- Reduce the opponent **Core HP** to **0**.

## Turn Structure (High level)
1. **Planning** — Choose actions / targets.
2. **Resolution** — Resolve effects in the specified order.
3. **End Step** — Apply ongoing effects / check win conditions.

## Core Passives
Each Core grants a passive effect that is always in effect unless overridden by rules.

## Temporal Vortex (concept)
A track/charge that builds and can be triggered by rules.

If you paste your full rule text here, I can format it cleanly and sync the in-app Rulebook view to it.
